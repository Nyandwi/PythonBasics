# Basis of Python for Machine Learning

Python has become the go-to programming language in Machine Learning industries and communities. It is a high-level programming language means it is very easy to use. 

Python is sometimes referred to as [“batteries included”](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html) due to its rich standard library. 


Advantages of Python:

* It is simple to read and write: Python syntaxes are very easy to write and easy to recall as well. 
* It has a beautiful design and built-in data types. 
* It has thousands of great libraries in many disciplines. Examples of such ML libraries are NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, etc.
* Supportive communities: Good documentation, courses, tutorials, social groups
* Easy to learn and use due to its simple syntaxes which feel like a natural language.
